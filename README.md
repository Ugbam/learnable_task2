## What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that records the changes made to a file or set of files over time so you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple collaborators to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.

## Difference Between Git and GitHub
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development.
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on Git repositories.

## GitHub Alternatives
Bitrise
Bitbucket
Harness

## Difference Between `git fetch` and `git pull`
git fetch: This command downloads the changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch.
git pull: Git pull collects changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch.

## Git Rebase
Git rebase is simply a command to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving or replaying commits. It avoids disorganisation and creates a cleaner commit history.

The command for git rebase is: git rebase branch-name

## Git Cherry-pick
This command selectes specific commits from one branch and applies it to another one. It is particularly useful in undoing changes.

The command for git cherry-pick is: git cherry-pick commit-hash
